  Lets talk about folders
    1. public
       contains 6 files
       robots
       as beginers need to concentrate the index.html
       
                 
          it has only single html page in react application
          might be we will do changs on header section not in body.
          if you want react to controll UI that purpose we are going to maintain one div tag that is id is root
          
          
     2. Starting point of react application is index.js
     
     What is component?
        1. component is represents the user interface . for example it will seperate heder, sidenave,main, footer
        
      How does translate the component to code?
         javascript File    App.js
         
         generally function type code it contains js file 
         
         two type of components i.e
         
            Function type component
            class type component
        
        
        Declare function component:
        
            1. Component 
                  create file on compoent folder then after
                    create function on component file
                   with default export
            2. import component in appl.js
            3. user that function in function app()
